I believe I am taking to the structure and best practice that is being presented in this subject. (I try not to steer away from what has been taught)

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

To tell the truth I have been pulled into working on other work projects that have lead to me trying to learn more than one programming language at a time. I need to organise my time to prioritise the learning in this subject in order to succeed and get the most from the learning.

## What are you currently doing poorly for practicals in this subject that you will change?

Submitting my practicals late. (Poor time management)

## What are you doing really well for practicals in this subject?

Reading through the instructions 2 to 4+ times to try and ensure I have read and followed what is written.
