## Lessons
### What I have learned about clean code:
* Clean code is always self documenting. It should always be clear 
what your code does to another developer reading it.
* Comments should only be used when absolutely necessary to clarify 
a particular part of your code. (This does not include trying to explain
away the use of bad practices like magic numbers!)
* Understanding imperative mood has been invaluable for avoiding things like bad naming,
bad commit messages etc. Nearly every single time I go to start a commit,
name a function, write a comment or docstring there is a little voice
constantly reminding myself of the ***~imperative mood~***
