# CP1404 Practical Reflection


## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

I have slowed down to practice and understand concepts more clearly to make sure I have a full understanding of what is being taught.

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

Time management has been terrible this week. I got very sick and struggled to get back on the horse. 

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

I think I am getting better at honing my attention to detail and will continue to improve on this (I am learning alot doing code reviews)

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I need to stop fearing this subject or feeling like my knowledgebase is far behind. It doesn't help to be overly self-critical. 

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

I personally love when use case examples are plucked from the real world for 
e.g. from this subject an example of a code review that Lindsay had received 
was extremely valuable. I don't know why but real examples of concepts in action outside 
the degree and analogies stick like tree sap to bark.
